"""ComfyUI client shared by the gimp-setup AI plug-ins (fully local AI).

Runs mask-based inpainting and text-to-image on a local ComfyUI server
with one of two edit models:

    klein   FLUX.2 klein (distilled, 4 steps)             fast
    qwen    Qwen-Image-Edit + Lightning 4-step LoRA        slower, follows
                                                           prompts better

Pure standard library and no GIMP imports, so the same file is installed
next to every ComfyUI plug-in (Generative Fill, AI Remove Selection and
AI Restore Photo) and can be run outside GIMP:

    comfyui_client.py fill   <klein|qwen> image.png mask.png out.png "a red ball"
    comfyui_client.py hide   <klein|qwen> image.png mask.png out.png
    comfyui_client.py remove <klein|qwen> image.png mask.png out.png
    comfyui_client.py clean  <klein|qwen> image.png mask.png out.png
    comfyui_client.py generate out.png "a lighthouse at dusk" [WxH]
    comfyui_client.py restore <klein|qwen> photo.png out.png [burns]

Masks are white-on-black PNGs of the image's size: WHITE marks the area
to change. `hide` hides the selected area from the model (objects in
photos); `clean` lets the model see it (text or marks printed over a
texture); `remove` and `fill` pick one, check the result and redo the
job the other way when it failed — see _inpaint_graph and inpaint.
`restore` redraws a whole scanned print with its damage repaired (the
Restore Photo plug-in keeps only the pixels that changed).

All pixel work (scaling, masking, pre-filling) happens inside the
ComfyUI graph with core nodes; the only custom node used is
ComfyUI-GGUF, and only when the Qwen model is a .gguf file.

The model files are not hard-coded: they are picked from what the
server's loader nodes list, by name pattern.

Server address: COMFYUI_URL environment variable, then the shared
gimp-setup file ~/.config/PhotoGIMP/comfyui-url (host and Flatpak
sandbox copies), then ComfyUI's own default.

        gray blank is avoided because on large holes the models return

        a hidden area comes back as a flat patch. Also for fills: the
        new content lands on the real background instead of a smooth
        box, and "erase the text" style prompts work.

    `check` adds the outputs is_flat ("flat") or is_unchanged ("changed")
    read. `crop` = (x, y, width, height) runs the model on that part of
    the image only (out_w/out_h are then the crop's size) and pastes the
